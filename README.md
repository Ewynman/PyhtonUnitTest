# Split Check Calculator and Unit Test

## About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of this project is to provide a Python script, `payBill.py`, that takes the total bill amount including tip and the number of guests as inputs, and outputs a dictionary that represents how much each guest should pay, with an option to assign any leftover amount to a randomly selected guest. The output also includes the name of the guest who received the extra amount if applicable. The script is tested using the unittest module with three test cases in `test.py` to ensure that it produces the expected results for various inputs. The script can be used to split a bill fairly among a group of people, and the tests ensure that it works correctly in different scenarios, such as when there is an extra amount or when the bill is zero.
